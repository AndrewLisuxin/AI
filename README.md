implemented different search techniques

1) hw2: Using min-max algorithm and alpha-beta pruning algorithm respectively to predict the best next-step choice according to 
different search depths.

2) hw3: Developed a system to infer the correctness of queries based on the knowledge base
        a. Parsed input files with LEX and YACC
        b. Converted KB to CNF 
        c. Designed data structures to implement efficient data storage and retrieval and maintain data consistency
        d. Reasoned the correctness of queries with the resolution inference algorithm
